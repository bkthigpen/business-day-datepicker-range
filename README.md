A datepicker component made using Vite, React and TypeScript

Project setup explanation: 

The project uses the following technologies

1. Vite
2. React
3. TypeScript

In addition, I've added eslint and prettier for linting and styling rules. I've also used the Airbnb eslint styleguide rules with a few modifications of my own (fixing EOL bug for Windows, etc.).
